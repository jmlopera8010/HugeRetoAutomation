Automation Strategy
1. Visual Regression Testing
Implement BackstopJS to monitor visual changes on the key or most-visited pages. This will help detect unexpected layout or design shifts during development.
2. Accessibility Validation
Use BrowserStackâ€™s accessibility checker to validate automated test cases and ensure compliance with accessibility standards.
3. Test Automation Priorities:
   
Smoke Tests
Focus on validating the most critical flows:
  Homepage
  Check for broken links
  Validate internal and external links
  Login
  Display of error messages for invalid credentials
  Successful login flow
  Registration
  Display of error messages for invalid input
  Successful account creation

End-to-End (E2E) Flow
Automate the main user journey:
  User login
  Product selection
  Payment form interaction
  Payment execution
  Order review in "Mi Cuenta"
  Log out

Component-Level Tests
  Ensure critical UI components behave as expected:
  Product cards
  Carousels
  Product information blocks
